# Overview

This project is an attempt to learn penetration testing using a suite of open source tools, with as few modifications as possible along with a low barrier of entry.

The Raspberry Pi is an appealing testbed for pentesting due to its low cost, great community support, small form factor, and simple design. Open source support also appears to have matured to the point that many distros now provide upstream builds that're compatible with the Raspberry Pi.
